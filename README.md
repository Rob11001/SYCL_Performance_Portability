# **Overview**
A project done for the HPC Master course. It's about evaluating the performance portability of matrix multiplication using SYCL on CPU and GPU. 

To have more info about the project read the report available in the repo.

## **Project's Structure**
The project's structure is the following:
- *baseline*: the directory containing the two baseline implementation (MKL and cuBLAS) and the collected data together with a simple python script to automate the data collection
- *mat_mul_verions*: the directory containing the 8 versions of Mat mul implemented and a directory tests 
    - *tests*: the directory containing the data collected for GPU and CPU inside the two directory named CPU and GPU,and together the python script used to collect and plot data and to autotune the various versions using HyperMapper (https://github.com/luinardi/hypermapper).
    - *CPU* and *GPU*: these two directory contain the collected results of the experiments diveded in three directory: 
        - *plots*: contains the various plots generated by the collected results
        - *samples*: contains the samples generated by HyperMapper during the tuning 
        - *times*: contains the executions time collected foreach verions
    - *json*: contains the JSONs used by the `hypermapper_test.py ` to autune the different versions
    - *results*: contains a excel file with the overall results

## **Requisites**
To replicate the results of the project you need to have:
- a SYCL implementation to compile and run the various matrix multiplication version. In particular in the experiment the program have been launched using the docker container available at the following repo (https://github.com/Luigi-Crisci/SYCL-docker) selecting as backend hipSYCL
- Python 3.8.10 to run the various scripts (you need to install the needed libraries too, like for example the hypermapper library to run the scripts, to install them just follow their respective guides)
- Intel(R) oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler to compile the baseline in oneAPI MKL. To install it follow Intel oneAPI official guide and to easily compile the mkl program use the following script:
```
source compile-mkl.sh mat_mul_mkl.cpp
```
- nvcc compiler to compile the baseline in cuBLAS. To install it follow NVIDIA official guide.
